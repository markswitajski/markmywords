I'm **Mark Switajski**, a Data Scientist.

I love working with data in R, gaming with my friends, and NBA basketball (Go Spurs Go!)

This website serves as a place for me to practice writing as well as toy around with fun data science projects.

For a rundown of my professional life please take a look at my [resume].
