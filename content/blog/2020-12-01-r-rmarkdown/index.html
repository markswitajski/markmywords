<h1>Hello there!</h1>
<p>Welcome to my personal website and, more specifically, my blog section. I am flattered to see that someone was interested in what I had to say.</p>
<p>I’ll mainly use this site as a mix of showcasing technical projects and blogging about data science related topics that I find interesting. I’m currently excited about honing my data visualization skills with <code>ggplot2</code> so if you’re into that sort of thing, check back often!</p>
<p>Also I will be showing off my dog, Jazz:</p>
