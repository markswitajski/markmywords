# Hello there!

Welcome to my personal website and, more specifically, my blog section. I am flattered to see that someone was interested in what I had to say. 


I'll mainly use this site as a mix of showcasing technical projects and blogging about data science related topics that I find interesting. I'm currently excited about honing my data visualization skills with `ggplot2` so if you're into that sort of thing, check back often!

Also I will be showing off my dog, Jazz:
